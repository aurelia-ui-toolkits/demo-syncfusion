### 1. Introduction
<br>
<br>
This application is an Aurelia application developers friendly **catalog** of all **[Syncfusion Essential Studio for JavaScript Widgets](http://js.syncfusion.com/demos/web)**, now available as Aurelia components. It is the Aurelia-UI-Toolkits **[Aurelia-Syncfusion bridge](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-syncfusion-bridge)** plugin that brings the Syncfusion Essential Studio for JavaScript widgets into Aurelia world and this **catalog** application is so far the most complex application using this interface.
<br>
<br>

This **catalog** application is envisioned to be the primary source of information for Aurelia application developers that are planning to use Aurelia Syncfusion JavaScript components to build the user interface for their new applications. We also hope that this set of Aurelia Syncfusion JavaScript components be equally attractive to Aurelia developers who never used Syncfusion JavaScript widgets before, as to Syncfusion JavaScript developers who never used Aurelia as their development framework.
<br>
<br>

In order to ensure that existing users of Syncfusion JavaScript widgets have easy transition to using Aurelia Syncfusion JavaScript components instead, the **[Project Status](http://aurelia-ui-toolkits.github.io/demo-syncfusion/#/project-status)** page of this application strictly resembles matching **[Essential Studio for JavaScript](http://js.syncfusion.com/)** page.
<br>
<br>

The most interesting feature of this application is the **[catalog](http://aurelia-ui-toolkits.github.io/demo-syncfusion/#/samples/grid/Default Functionalities)** of all Aurelia components, a set of well structured pages (one per Aurelia component). The internal organization of the catalog is described in the Docs section **[Components catalog](#/help/docs/about_this_application/3._components_catalog)** section.
